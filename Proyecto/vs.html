                            Webb's look at the "cosmic cliffs" in the Carina Nebula reveals the earliest and fastest phases of star formation that had previously been hidden. By observing this star-forming region in the southern hemisphere constellation Carina, as well as other similar constellations, Webb can see new stars forming and study the gas and dust that formed them.

                             Webb has provided the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date, and in just 12.5 hours. To a person observing the sky from the ground, the field of view of this new image, a color composite of multiple exposures lasting about two hours, is about the size of a grain of sand held at arm's length. This deep field uses a galaxy cluster as a gravitational lens to find some of the most distant galaxies ever detected. This image is just a small example of Webb's ability to study deep fields and trace galaxies back to the beginning of cosmic time.

Scientists can now gain rare insight, in unprecedented detail, into how interacting galaxies trigger star formation and how gas is altered in these galaxies.

                            This planetary nebula, an expanding cloud of gas surrounding a dying star, is about 2,000 light-years away. Here, Webb's powerful infrared gaze brings a second, dying star into full view for the first time. From his birth to his death as a planetary nebula, Webb can explore the layers of dust and gas that expel aging stars that may one day become a new star or planet.

                            The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's largest and most powerful space telescope, focusing on infrared light, a low-frequency spectrum that will shed clues to the far reaches of the universe.
The James Webb Space Telescope was launched on Christmas Day 2021, its construction took 40 million hours, that is, 32 years of work.
Located approximately 1.5 million kilometers from our planet.
It is formed by a series of hexagonal mirrors that capture the light of the universe and distribute it to the different scientific instruments.
